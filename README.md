# Movie Backlog

I needed a way to keep track of movies I want to watch and I figured I could use this opportunity to build a simple app that can create a backlog list of movies.

I chose to use Svelte as it's JavaScript framework I've been learning by going through the Svelte tutorials provided on their official website [svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/).

## Setup 

- Install packages
```
npm install
```
## Commands
- Run app in development
```
npm run dev
```
